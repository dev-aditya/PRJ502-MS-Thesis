First and foremost, I thank Prof. Jan M. Rost for granting me the opportunity to be a part of this project. My tenure at PKS has been an incredibly positive and enriching experience that I will always cherish. 

The journey through this endeavor would have been unimaginably difficult without the guidance of Dr. Sebastian Gemshiem. I am profoundly grateful to him for his countless hours of discussing and mentoring me during my time at PKS. His impact on me goes beyond academics.

I thank Dr. Abhishek Chaudhuri for his support, inspiring teachings, and mentorship during my time at IISER Mohali and for being an incredible local supervisor. He has always been a source of inspiration for me. Similarly, my thanks go to Dr. Ambresh Shivai and Dr. Ramandeep S. Johal for their participation in my thesis committee. I want to mention that Dr. Ambresh's Special Topics in Particle Physics class has been the best course I ever had at IISER Mohali. 

I appreciate the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, for supporting my academic journey with the INSPIRE Scholarship. And IISER Mohali Computing and Library for providing me with the required infrastructure throughout my academic journey, 



While my journey was brightened by the presence of numerous friends at IISER and PKS, who added color and joy in countless ways, I'll hold back from naming them all to avoid the fear of leaving anyone out. However, a special shoutout to Milena Simic for those unforgettable hikes in SÃ¤chsische Schweiz. Those moments are etched in my memory!


Lastly, my deepest and most heartfelt gratitude goes to my parents. Their unconditional love, unwavering support, and boundless encouragement have been my rock. They believed in me when I doubted myself and cheered me on to reach new heights. I owe everything I am and all that I've achieved to them.
