\chapter[Semi-Classics of Jaynes-Cumming]{Classical Limit of Jaynes Cumming Model\label{chap:braun_briggs_jaynes}}

It has been shown in\refchap{chap:briggs_rost_semiclassic} how one can reduce a TISE to a TDSE for a system in the presence of a classical environment. In this chapter, we will discuss the application of the previous chapter to a simple model of light-matter interaction and enumerating the conditions that must be obtained in order to treat the electromagnetic field classically.

Consider a time-independent problem of a quantum system, with a Hamiltonian
