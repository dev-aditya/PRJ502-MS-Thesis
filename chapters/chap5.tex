In \refchap{chap:braun_briggs_jaynes} we discussed the semi-classical approach to derive the Time Dependent Schr\"odinger Equation (TDSE), governing the Jaynes-Cummmings model. 

\newpage

In \refsec{sec:class_jcm_sec1}, we derived the TDSE in the position space representation, by assuming a semiclassical (WKB-like) wave function for the field mode and \refsec{sec:sec:class_jcm_sec2} presented an alternative derivation, i.e., by making use of coherent state representation.
However,  both these approaches inherit the concept of ``time" as a purely classical parameter, compromising its deeper and more fundamental nature.

On the contrary, in \refchap{chap:sebgem_Rel}, we presented a purely quantum-mechanical framework to describe the dynamics of the general interacting quantum system from the relational point of view. Here, ``time" emerges as a symmetry parameter stemming from the principle of global invariance of the global energy eigenstate of the total Hamiltonian.

A natural question arises: Are both of these different approaches to describe the dynamics of the system (relationally) equivalent? If so, then in what limit? In this chapter, we aim to address these questions. We begin by adopting the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian as our model system. We then explore the Jaynes-Cummings model from the perspective of Quantum Relational Dynamics. We aim to examine the transition from a purely quantum environment to a classical environment, as previously discussed in \refchap{chap:braun_briggs_jaynes}, and to juxtapose the dynamics as characterized by these two distinct approaches. We demonstrate that the two approaches yield identical results under appropriate limits (consistent with the semiclassical treatment in previous chapters). 


We assume our Hamiltonian to be of the form,

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{eqnarray}
        \label{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian}
        \oper{H} = \frac{\hbar \omega_0}{2} \oper{\sigma}_z + \hbar \omega \left(\oper{a}^\dagger \oper{a} + \frac{1}{2}\right) 
        + \hbar g \oper{\sigma}_x\left(\oper{a} + \oper{a}^\dagger\right). 
\end{eqnarray}
\end{mdframed}
Under dipole-approximation and rotating-wave approximation~\cite[Chap 2]{Bina_JC_tutorial} the above Hamiltonian (\refeq{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian}) can be written as
\begin{mdframed}
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_RWA}
        \oper{H} = \frac{\hbar \omega_0}{2} \oper{\sigma}_z + \hbar \omega \left(\oper{a}^\dagger \oper{a} + \frac{1}{2}\right) 
        + \hbar g \left(\oper{\sigma}_+ \oper{a} + \oper{\sigma}_- \oper{a}^\dagger\right).
\end{equation}
\end{mdframed}

\section[Exact Energy Eigenstate of JC-Hamiltonian]{Exact Energy Eigenstate of JC-Hamiltonian (resonant case)}

In the specific scenario of the Hamiltonian in Equation \ref{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_RWA}, when 
\(\omega  = \omega_0\), known as the 
``resonance case," the system becomes exactly solvable.
This model is characterized by the Hamiltonian operator\footnote{Here, we dropped the \(1/2\) term from \(H_c\), 
simplifying calculations. This adjustment doesn't affect our analysis.}
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_resonance}
        \oper{H} = \frac{\hbar\omega}{2} \oper{\sigma}_z + \hbar \omega \oper{a}^\dagger \oper{a}
        + \hbar g \left(\oper{\sigma}_+ \oper{a} + \oper{\sigma}_- \oper{a}^\dagger\right). 
\end{equation}
It portrays the resonant interaction between two energy levels of an atom and a single Boson field mode.
To understand how this system evolves over time, we initially aim to compute the unitary evolution operator 
$U(t) = e^{-i t H/\hbar}$ through the diagonalization of $H$. Once we achieve an eigenvalue decomposition 
$H = \sum_n \epsilon_n \lvert \epsilon_n \rangle \langle \epsilon_n \rvert$, it follows that:

\begin{equation}
U(t) = \sum_n e^{-i t \epsilon_n/\hbar} \lvert \epsilon_n \rangle \langle \epsilon_n \rvert
\end{equation}

Finding such an eigenvalue decomposition is not trivial, particularly in this context, 
given the infinite-dimensional nature of the underlying Hilbert space. However, the 
JC-Hamiltonian possesses a notably simple structure as it is block-diagonal with respect 
to the $\ket{\pm, n}$-basis. The diagonalization of the JC-Hamiltonian in 
\refeq{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_resonance} is given in \refapp{appen:chap5_JC_calculations} .
Once you diagonalize the Hamiltonian, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the JC-Hamiltonian are given by
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:chap5_JCM_eigenvalues}
        E_{\pm, n} = \hbar \omega \left(n - \frac{1}{2}\right) \pm \hbar g \sqrt{n + 1},
\end{equation}
and the corresponding eigenvectors are
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:chap5_JCM_eigenvectors}
        \ket*{\psi_{n,\pm}} := \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
     \left( \ket*{+, n - 1} \pm \ket*{-, n} \right).
\end{equation}
In addition, the exact analytical form of the unitary evolution operator is [refer to \refapp{appen:chap5_JC_calculations}]
\begin{align}
    U(t)  
    &= e^{\frac{1}{2} i t \omega } \ket*{-, 0}\bra*{-, 0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-i t \omega (n - \frac{1}{2})} e^{-i t g \sqrt{n}} \ket*{\psi_{n,+}}\bra*{\psi_{n,+}} \nonumber \\
     &+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-i t \omega (n - \frac{1}{2})} e^{i t g \sqrt{n}} \ket*{\psi_{n,-}}\bra*{\psi_{n,-}} \nonumber \\
    &= e^{\frac{1}{2} i t \omega }\ket*{-, 0}\bra*{-, 0} \nonumber \\
     &+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-i t \omega (n - \frac{1}{2})} \Big[ \cos(t g \sqrt{n}) \left( \ket*{+, n - 1}\bra*{+, n - 1} + \ket*{-, n}\bra*{-, n} \right) \nonumber \\
     &- i \sin(t g \sqrt{n}) \left( \ket*{+, n - 1}\bra*{-, n} + \ket*{-, n}\bra*{+, n - 1} \right) \Big].
\end{align}
We discussed the coherent state-based semiclassical approximation in Chapter
\ref{chap:braun_briggs_jaynes}, where the final result simply involved replacing
the field operators, i.e., \( \oper{a} \) and \( \oper{a}^\dagger \), with their
classical expectation values. Following a similar approach, we could assume the semi-classical form
of the Hamiltonian in Equation \ref{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_resonance} as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_semi}
    \begin{aligned}
        \oper{H}_{\text{semi}} = \frac{\hbar\omega}{2} \oper{\sigma}_z + \hbar \omega \langle \oper{a}^\dagger \oper{a} \rangle
    + \hbar g \left( \oper{\sigma}_+ \langle \oper{a} \rangle + \oper{\sigma}_- \langle \oper{a}^\dagger \rangle \right),\\
    = \frac{\hbar\omega}{2} \oper{\sigma}_z + \hbar \omega N 
    + \hbar g \alpha\left( \oper{\sigma}_+ e^{-it\omega} + \oper{\sigma}_- e^{it\omega} \right),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(\langle a(t) \rangle = \alpha e^{-i\omega t}\). This leads to the evolution operator being expressed as
%\begin{align}
%        \tilde{U}(t) &= 
%                \cos(\Omega t) \left(e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{+}\bra{+} + 
%                e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{-}\bra{-} \right)  \nonumber\\
%                &- i \sin(\Omega t)
%                 \left( e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{+}\bra{-}
%                + e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{-}\bra{+}\right)
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
        \tilde{U}(t) &= 
                \cos(\Omega t) \left(\ket{+}\bra{+} + 
                \ket{-}\bra{-} \right)  \nonumber\\
                &- i \sin(\Omega t)
                 \left( \ket{+}\bra{-}
                +\ket{-}\bra{+}\right)
\end{align}
where \(\Omega = \frac{g\alpha}{\hbar}\). We will see in the next section (\refsec{sec:chap5_large_amplitude_weak_g}) that the semiclassical limit can be made more rigorous
under the limits discussed \refchap{chap:braun_briggs_jaynes}, i.e., in the limit of
large photon number and weak ``back-coupling'' from the quantum system.

\section{Semiclassical JC-Hamiltonian  in Large Amplitude and Weak Interaction Limit\label{sec:chap5_large_amplitude_weak_g}}
It would be a reasonable assumption to anticipate the emergence of semi-classicality when the fields are in a state of coherence. However, recovering semi-classical behavior is not straightforward by simply substituting the quantum degree of freedom with their classical expectation values (as was done in \refeq{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_semi}). 

Building upon this observation, we posit that the emergence of semi-classical behavior is contingent upon specific, well-defined conditions. This assertion is further supported by the findings presented in~\cite{semiclassical_limit_JC_PRL}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Large Amplitude of Coherent State}: When the amplitude of the coherent state is substantial, 
    the quantum fluctuations (i.e., the influence of atom onto the field in our model!) become less significant, 
    resembling classical behavior.
    \item \textbf{Weak Atom-Mode Coupling}: If the coupling between the atom and the mode (field) is weak, 
    the quantum effects become less pronounced, favoring semiclassical behavior.
\end{itemize}
In this section, we will explore an interesting limit of \refeq{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian}, corresponding to the aforementioned conditions. We will consider what happens when the factor, $g = \frac{\Omega}{|\alpha|} \to 0$, as $|\alpha| \rightarrow \infty$. Here, $\Omega$ represents a fixed constant\footnote{\(\Omega\) sets the energy  scale of the problem in consideration}. While we won't delve into rigorous proofs, the following discussion will argue that, under these conditions, the dynamics of the atomic system can still be described by unitary evolution. To begin, let us recall the form of coherent states.
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\alpha} = e^{-\frac{1}{2}|\alpha|^2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha^n}{\sqrt{n!}} \ket{n}
\end{equation}
A unique feature of these states is that the particle number has a Poisson distribution. In other words, the probability of finding the system in photon number state, \(\ket{n}\) is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{p}_n = \abs*{\bra*{n}\ket*{\alpha}}^2 
    = e^{-\abs*{\alpha}^2}\frac{(\abs*{\alpha}^2)^n}{n!}
\end{equation}
Our objective is to understand the evolution of the atom when it interacts with a coherent state. 
Therefore, we aim to compute the reduced density operator of the atom, which is given by:

\begin{align}
\oper{\rho}_{\text{atom}}(t) &= 
\text{Tr}_{\text{mode}} \left( U(t)[\oper{\rho} \otimes \ket{\alpha}\bra{\alpha}]U^\dagger(t) \right) \nonumber \\
 &= \sum_n e^{-\gamma} \gamma^n \frac{V_g(n)\oper{\rho} V_g^\dagger(n)}{n!},
\end{align}

where \(\gamma = \abs{\alpha}\) and\footnote{[Refer to \refapp{appen:chap5_JC_calculations} for explicit form of \(U(t)\)]}:
\begin{align}
        \label{eq:appen_JCM_V_g}
    V_g (n) &=e^{-it\omega\frac{1}{2}}  \cos(tg\sqrt{n + 1})\ket{+}\bra{+}\\
&+ e^{it\omega\frac{1}{2}} \cos(tg\sqrt{n})\ket{-}\bra{-}\\
&- ie^{-it\omega\frac{1}{2}} \sin(tg\sqrt{n + 1}) \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{n + 1}} \ket{+}\bra{-}\\
&- ie^{-t\omega\frac{1}{2}} \sin(tg\sqrt{n}) \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\alpha} \ket{-}\bra{+}.
\end{align}
These square roots and \(\alpha\) are quite bothersome. If we could eliminate them, we would achieve a unitary evolution. To facilitate this, let us make a few observations. First, as \( x \) increases, the function
\( \sqrt{x} \) becomes flatter (its derivative approaches zero).  Second, as the mean increases, the Poisson distribution increasingly peaks and concentrates around the mean, as illustrated in \reffig{fig:poission_sqrt}, the Poisson distribution is approximately equivalent to the normal distribution (in large mean limit), 
\begin{equation}
\mathfrak{N}_{\mu, \sigma}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}.
\end{equation}
In the context of coherent states, the approximate normal distribution has a mean of \( |\alpha|^2 \) and a
standard deviation of \( |\alpha| \). 
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/chap5/poisson_distribution.pdf}
  \caption{The plot compares the Poisson distribution for large mean values with a square root function. As the mean increases, the Poisson distribution increasingly peaks and concentrates around the mean, while the square root function remains nearly flat for large values. }
  \label{fig:poission_sqrt}
\end{wrapfigure} 
This implies that the width of the distribution increases at a slower rate than the mean. Consequently, for large \( |\alpha| \), it is plausible that the square root remains nearly constant within the region where the Poisson/normal 
distribution is significant. On considering these observations, the subsequent reasoning for the approximation might be easier to grasp.
\begin{equation}
\oper{\rho}_{\text{atom}}(t) = \sum_n e^{-\gamma} \gamma^n \frac{V_g(n)\oper{\rho} V_g^\dagger(n)}{n!}
\end{equation}
By approximating the weighted sum over the Poisson distribution with the integral weighted by 
the normal distribution \( \mathfrak{N}_{\mu, \sigma}(x)\), having a mean (\( \mu =  |\alpha|^2 \)) 
and standard deviation (\( \sigma = |\alpha| \)), we obtain

\begin{equation}
    \oper{\rho}_{\text{atom}}(t)\approx \int \mathfrak{N}_{\mu, \sigma}(x) V(t, x) \oper{\rho} V(t, x)^{\dagger} dx
\end{equation}
We cut away the tails of the integral at (\( s \)) standard deviations
\begin{equation}
    \oper{\rho}_{\text{atom}}(t)\approx \int_{|\alpha|^2 - s|\alpha|}^{|\alpha|^2 + s|\alpha|}\mathfrak{N}_{\mu, \sigma}(x) V(t, x) \oper{\rho} V(t, x)^{\dagger} dx
\end{equation}
A change of variables gives (\( x \to x|\alpha| + |\alpha|^2 \))

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:appen_JCM_rho_atom_t}
    \begin{aligned}
        \oper{\rho}_{\text{atom}}(t)= \int_{-s}^{s} \mathfrak{N}_{0, 1}(x) V(x|\alpha| + |\alpha|^2) 
    \oper{\rho} V(x|\alpha| + |\alpha|^2)^{\dagger} dx
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Now we put in our assumption that \(g = \hbar\Omega / \abs*{\alpha}\). Let's assume, 
for simplicity, that \(\alpha = \abs*{\alpha}\), i.e., it's real. Then \refeq{eq:appen_JCM_V_g} becomes
\begin{align}
    V_{\Omega/|\alpha|}(x|\alpha| + |\alpha|^2) 
    &= e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\cos \left( t\Omega \sqrt{1 + \frac{x}{\abs*{\alpha}}+ \frac{1}{\abs*{\alpha}^2}} \right) \ket{+}\bra{+} \nonumber \\
    &+ e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2} }\cos \left( t\Omega \sqrt{1 + \frac{x}{\abs*{\alpha}}} \right) \ket{-}\bra{-} \nonumber \\
    &- i e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2} }\sin \left( t\Omega \sqrt{1 + \frac{x}{\abs*{\alpha}} + \frac{1}{\abs*{\alpha}^2}} \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{x}{\abs*{\alpha}} + 1}} \ket{+}\bra{-} \nonumber \\
    &- i e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}} \sin \left( t\Omega \sqrt{1 + \frac{x}{\abs*{\alpha}}} \right) \sqrt{1 + \frac{x}{\abs*{\alpha}}} \ket{-}\bra{+}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Since, \(-s < x < s\), with \(s\) constant, in the limit of \(|\alpha| \to \infty\),
\begin{align}
        \label{eq:appen_JCM_V_g_limit}
    \tilde{U}(t) &:= \lim_{\abs*{\alpha}^2 \to \infty} 
    V_{\Omega/|\alpha|}(x|\alpha| + |\alpha|^2)  \nonumber \\
    &= \cos(\Omega t) \left(e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{+}\bra{+} + 
    e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{-}\bra{-} \right)  \nonumber \\
    &- i \sin(\Omega t)
     \left( e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{+}\bra{-}
    + e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{-}\bra{+}\right)  \nonumber \\
\end{align}
Inserting this limit back into \refeq{eq:appen_JCM_rho_atom_t}, we obtain
\begin{align}
    \oper{\rho}_{\text{atom}}(t) &\approx \int_{-s}^{s} \mathfrak{N}_{0, 1}(x) \tilde{U}(t) \oper{\rho} \tilde{U}(t)^{\dagger} dx \nonumber\\
        &\approx \tilde{U}(t) \oper{\rho} \tilde{U}(t)^{\dagger}.
\end{align}
Hence, in the limit of large \(\alpha\) and weak interactions, we get the 
semiclassical limit. The final form of the evolution operator is given in \refeq{eq:appen_JCM_V_g_limit}, i.e., 
\begin{mdframed}
    \begin{align}
    \label{eq:appen_JCM_V_g_limit2}
    \tilde{U}(t) 
    &= \cos(\Omega t) \left(e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{+}\bra{+} + 
    e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{-}\bra{-} \right)  \nonumber \\
    &- i \sin(\Omega t)
     \left( e^{-i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{+}\bra{-}
    + e^{i t \omega \frac{1}{2}}\ket{-}\bra{+}\right) 
\end{align}
\end{mdframed}
\refeq{eq:appen_JCM_V_g_limit2} describes the unitary progression of a two-level atom within the JC Hamiltonian, under the conditions of a high amplitude coherent state and a weak interaction limit. This will be employed in the upcoming sections to derive the precise semi-classical dynamics of our model system. 
\section{Numerical Results: Comparing Quantum Relational Dynamics with Semiclassical Dynamics
\label{sec:chap5_numerical_results}}
The structure of this section is as follows: It presents the results of numerical simulations that investigate the relational dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under both quantum mechanical and semiclassical paradigms. The focus will be on exploring the system's time evolution within the contexts of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and the original, non-rotating wave approximation (NRWA). A detailed analysis of these numerical findings will be provided in \refsec{sec:discussion}.

    + \hbar \frac{g}{\abs*{\alpha}} \oper{\sigma}_x\left( \alpha e^{-it\omega} + \alpha e^{it\omega} \right).
\end{eqnarray}
The clock (environment) quantum state, onto which the global eigenstate is projected
to extract the quantum dynamics, is taken to be
the coherent states \(\ket*{\alpha (t)}\), where \(\alpha(t) = \alpha e^{-i\omega t}\). The dynamics of the quantum state of the system is then obtained according to \refeq{eq:nonint_sys_evol}, i.e.,  
\begin{equation}
    \ket*{\psi_{rel}(t)} = \mathcal{N} \innerGlob{\alpha(t)}{\Psi_{\mathrm{glob}}},
    \mathcal{N} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lvert \lvert \innerGlob{\alpha(t)}{\Psi_{\mathrm{glob}}} \rvert \rvert^2}}
\end{equation}
where \(\ket*{\Psi_{E_{glob}}}\) is an eigenstate of \refeq{eq:chap5_JCM_Hamiltonian_linear}. 

The initial state is taken as \(\ket*{\psi_{semi}(0)} = N\innerGlob{\alpha(0)}{\Psi_{E_{glob}}}\), where $N$ denotes normalization for the semiclassical time evolution. The plots are shown
for three different global energy eigenstates and a fixed \(E_c(\alpha^2) = \hbar \omega \abs*{\alpha}^2\). The overlap \(\abs*{\braket*{\psi_{rel}}{\psi_{semi}}}\) for the identical time evolution is depicted in \reffig{fig:chap5_linear_semi_vs_quant}.

\section{Discussion\label{sec:discussion}}
The numerical results presented in \refsec{sec:chap5_numerical_results} show a good agreement
between the classical limit of quantum relational theory and the semi-classical theories
discussed in \refchap{chap:braun_briggs_jaynes} and \refsec{sec:chap5_large_amplitude_weak_g}, under appropriate limits. 
The agreement is more pronounced for the non-rotating wave approximation than for the rotating wave approximation. This is expected as the rotating wave approximation is a more stringent approximation, and the
agreement is expected to be better for the non-rotating wave approximation.
The agreement is close when the \(E_c \approx E_{\mathrm{glob}}\), 
i.e., the energy carried by the environment state is near the energy of the global state. 

Additionally,  the above analysis reveals a key trend; as we increase the average number of photons (\(\alpha^2\)), and while the energy
of the global eigenstate is close to the energy of the conditional state of the environment, the average overlap curve flattens, indicating better agreement even for larger fluctuations of \(E_c\) around \(E_{\mathrm{glob}}\). This implies that the weak back-coupling limit maintains the semiclassical behavior even for a larger deviation of \(E_c\) about the global system's energy, which can be seen both in \reffig{fig:chap5_linear_overlap_avg} and in \reffig{fig:chap5_JCM_overlap_avg}. 

Our numerical results align with the conditions outlined in previous chapters for a classical treatment of the environment. These conditions stipulate that the environment should possess most of the global system's energy content and since, for our case, the coupling \(g \propto \frac{1}{\abs*{\alpha}}\). Hence, for \(\abs*{\alpha} \to \infty \implies g \to 0\). This signifies a weak interaction limit, where the ``back coupling", or the influence of the quantum system on the environment, becomes negligible.

\paragraph{Coherent states as clock states:} Our work suggests that coherent states are the most suitable candidates for ``clock states" in the quantum relational framework, particularly when considering the classical limit of the theory. In this context, the classical limit of the quantum approach aligns seamlessly with established semiclassical theories. As discussed in~\cite{braun2004classical}, coherent states offer a significant advantage in semi-classical theory. They elegantly overcome the challenge of defining time derivatives near classical turning points, leading to a more robust treatment of the problem. 

Another intriguing aspect of coherent states is their potential connection to decoherence. Theoretical studies have conclusively demonstrated that when a single-mode Boson field interacts with its environment and undergoes decoherence – the process by which quantum systems lose their superposition and entanglement properties – the field transitions naturally to a coherent state. Remarkably, the only solution of the ``master equation" that remains pure in the presence of decoherence are coherent states (Gaussian states)~\cite{dutra1998decoherence, zuerk_coherent_state_1993}. 

\paragraph{Potential Connection with Entanglement measure: } As discussed in previous chapters, \textit{disentangling} the environment from the quantum subsystem is crucial for extracting the subsystem dynamics in semi-classical theory.  In a simplified sense, this \textit{disentanglement} can be achieved by substituting the degrees of freedom of the environment with their classical trajectories (replacing operators such as $\oper{Q}$ with $Q (t)$ within the interaction potential. In other words, $\oper{V}(\oper{x}, \oper{Q})$ becomes $\oper{V}(\oper{x}, Q(t))$. . By comparing the resulting ``emergent potential" (\refeq{eq:effective_Vs}) with this ``semi-classical" potential, a measure of entanglement could potentially be established.
